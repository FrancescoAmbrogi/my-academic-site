## What you will learn
An introductory course in fluid mechanics with application to fluid power systems. Topics include properties of fluids, fluids at rest, dimensional analysis, the laws of conservation of mass and momentum, Bernoulli's equation for incompressible flow and the energy equation, flow measurements, elementary pipe flow problems including losses due to pumps, valves etc. Laboratories will introduce students to pressure and flow measuring devices, pneumatic and hydraulic components and actuators, and circuit analysis of fluid power systems. Upon completion of the course students will be able to:

1. Define a fluid based on its thermodynamic properties.
2. Distinguish between a Eulerian and a Lagrangian approach to fluid mechanics.
3. Compute pressure distribution and forces on submerged bodies in a static fluid.
4. Handle flow problems in an integral framework using the conservation of mass and momentum.
5. Understand the relevance of dimensional analysis and non-dimensional groups.
6. Use Bernoulli’s equation to solve simple flow problems involving Pitot probes and Bernoulli’s
obstacles.
7. Solve pipe flow problems and piping systems involving pumps, minor and major losses.

## Pre-requisite knowledge
This course is a requirement for all second year Mechanical and Materials Engineering students at Queen’s University. This course is designed for learners who have successfully completed the first-year program in engineering and a course in differential equations. Learners must have completed the prerequisite course (APSC 111 - Physics) or a similar course.

**Required textbook:** Fundamentals of Fluid Mechanics, Seventh Edition, Munson (Wiley)

## Suggested time commitment
Generally, we expect that students attend all lectures (3hrs/week), review material at home (1 hr/week), complete the weekly assignment problems (1-2 hrs/week - if an assignment takes much more than 1 hr you should be doing additional problems and coming to tutorials and office hours for additional help understanding, about another 2 hours a week). If you keep up your understanding week to week, then a few hours review should be enough to do well on the final exam. An average student will be able to do well in this course by spending about 6 hours a week, over the twelve-week term.
