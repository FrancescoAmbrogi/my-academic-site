## What you will learn
This is an introductory course in fluid mechanics. The main goal is to give students a basic understanding of fluid mechanics principles and their application to the design and analysis of practical engineering systems. Upon completion of the course students will be able to:
1. Define a fluid based on its thermodynamic properties.
2. Distinguish between a Eulerian and a Lagrangian approach to fluid mechanics.
3. Compute pressure distribution and forces on submerged bodies in a static fluid.
4. Handle flow problems in an integral framework using the conservation of mass and momentum.
5. Understand the relevance of dimensional analysis and non-dimensional groups.
6. Use Bernoulli’s equation to solve simple flow problems involving Pitot probes and Bernoulli’s
obstacles.
7. Solve simple flow fields using the Navier-Stokes system of equations with appropriate
assumptions and boundary conditions.
8. Solve pipe flow problems and piping systems involving pumps, minor and major losses.

## Pre-requisite knowledge
This course is a requirement for all second year Mechanical and Materials Engineering students at Queen’s University. This course is designed for learners who have successfully completed the first-year program in engineering and a course in differential equations. Learners must have completed the prerequisite course (APSC 111 - Physics) or a similar course.

## Suggested time commitment
Generally, we expect that students attend all lectures (3hrs/week), review material at home (1 hr/week), complete the weekly assignment problems (1-2 hrs/week - if an assignment takes much more than 1 hr you should be doing additional problems and coming to tutorials and office hours for additional help understanding, about another 2 hours a week). If you keep up your understanding week to week, then a few hours review should be enough to do well on the final exam. An average student will be able to do well in this course by spending about 6 hours a week, over the twelve-week term.

## FAQs

{{< spoiler text="Are there prerequisites?" >}}
The only ones I could think of are: a basic knowledge of Calculus and Physics.

{{< spoiler text="Is there a lot of math?" >}}
There is a REASONABLE amount of math. However, nothing you can't handle!

{{< spoiler text="Do I need to memorize a lot?" >}}
You DO NOT. The equations you must remember are very few and very simple. I will always allow students to take the exam with a single-sided or double-sided formula sheet.
