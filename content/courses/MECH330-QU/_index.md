## What you will learn
A continuation of MECH 230 (Applied thermodynamics I) with selected topics such as gas and vapour power cycles, refrigeration, mixtures of gases and vapours, combustion, and available energy. In this course students learn about:

1. Calculate energy efficiency changes using re-heating, regeneration, use of open and closed feedwater heaters, and deaerators in vapour power systems (Vapour power).
2. Calculate energy efficiency changes associated with regenerative heating through use of heat exchangers, re-heat and intercooling in gas power systems or Brayton Cycles (Gas power).
3. Use exergy analysis to calculate energy availability and effectiveness (Exergy).
4. Calculate the coefficients of performances of vapour compression and Brayton refrigeration cycles that use different working fluids with multistage compression and intercooling in refrigeration and heat pump systems (Refrigeration).
5. Calculate thermodynamic properties of ideal gas mixtures, including gases that contain water vapour and apply the Psychrometric chart (Psychrometrics).
6. Calculate the energy release from combustible mixtures, including the lower and higher heating values (Combustion).

## Pre-requisite knowledge
This course builds on knowledge from the successful completion of prerequisite courses, some review will be covered in first weeks of course.
## Course materials

Download the **Course Syllabus** [HERE](./Syllabus_mech330_f24.pdf)

**Suggested textbook:** Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics 9th Ed. by Moran, Shapiro, Boettner, and Bailey, Wiley

## Suggested time commitment
Generally, we expect that students attend all lectures (3hrs/week), review material at home (1 hr/week), complete the weekly assignment problems (1-2 hrs/week - if an assignment takes much more than 1 hr you should be doing additional problems and coming to tutorials and office hours for additional help understanding, about another 2 hours a week). If you keep up your understanding week to week, then a few hours review should be enough to do well on the final exam. An average student will be able to do well in this course by spending about 6 hours a week, over the twelve-week term.

## Students feedback

{{< spoiler text="Student A" >}}
I LOVE FRANCESCO. I have never ever in my life left a review for any prof. I never thought I would find myself loving thermodynamics, but here I am. I genuinely want to attend all his lectures and am engaged throughout. He's incredible, a great professor, charismatic, caring, he learned my name and he learns everyone's name. Best prof I ever had.

Franceso is one of my favourite instructors here at Queen's. It is evident that he is passionate about the topic and ensuring that students really understand what he is teaching. Franceso is very approachable and I would not hesitate to ask him any questions. I feel I do better with this topic because he is the instructor.

Francesco has been my favourite instructor I have had in my 3 years at Queen's. His commitment to his student's learning and understanding is unmatched, evident through spending his time running tutorial sessions. He is always helpful when questions are asked of him and makes students feel passionate about what he is teaching.
