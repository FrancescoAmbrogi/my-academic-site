## Overview
During the Winter term 2023, I had the wonderful opportunity to teach Fluid Mechanics I (MECH241) to second year engineering students at Queen's University. It was an amazing experience: it was refreshing, stimulating, and exciting. It was my very first time desiging a course from the beginning, and teaching some of the topic I am extremely passionate about. For my work as teaching fellow, I received the Silver Wrench Award on April 2023 during the Mechanical Engineering Banquet.

Presented on an annual basis, this award recognizes the professor who displays the most interest and enthusiasm towards Mechanical Engineering as chosen by the graduating year.

I want to extend my profound gratitude to my wife Veronica, who has the courage to stand by my side every single day, to everyone in the Department, including my supervisor [Prof. Piomelli](https://me.queensu.ca/People/Piomelli/index.html) and my fellow colleagues at the [TSM-Lab](https://me.queensu.ca/People/Piomelli/TSMLab.html), and to every instructor I have had the pleasure to work with.
