## Overview
I often tell this story to students in my class: Italy, fall 2017, I was a curious master student following a (very difficult) fluid mechanics class. Confused about the boundary layer thickness I asked a question. The professor paused, erased the board, and explained the same concept in three different ways. That day we did not learn any new concept, and I am sure the professor did not complete his daily plan, but everybody (including a very happy me) walked out of the class with a very clear understanding of boundary layer theory. That day I was inspired, and that professor profoundly changed my future choices. I knew then, I wanted to DO THAT to other students!

As of May 1st 2025, I will join the Mechanical and Materials Engineering department at [Stephen J. R. Smith Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science](https://smithengineering.queensu.ca/index.html) at Queen's University as an assistant professor. I have been dreaming about this moment since that fall of 2017.

I will teach and do research in a beautiful and safe environment among wonderful colleagues: people that I want to learn from, people I can't wait to work with, and people that had a huge impact on my academic career. 

I am beyond excited to be part of reimagining Engineering Education in what will probably be the most exciting years for both students and educators. 

**AD MAIORA SEMPER**
