## Overview
What a month!!

For the 3rd consecutive year I received the Silver Wrench Award by the mechanical and materials engineering department at [Stephen J. R. Smith Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science at Queen's University](https://smithengineering.queensu.ca/index.html). This time was even more special as I co-won the award with my colleague [John Kurelek](https://smithengineering.queensu.ca/directory/faculty/john-w-kurelek.html). Note that both of us teach in the thermo-fluids curriculum.

The other award that filled my heart with joy is the "Most approachable professor" award by the Mechatronics and Robotics engineering program, that I received during the first ever TRON banquet. This award is presented to the professor who creates a welcoming environment for questions, whether in class or office hours, making sure no student feels like their question is a bad one. Building a safe and welcoming learning environment is at the core of my teaching philosophy, and I could not be happier for this outcome!
