## Overview
What a fantastic journey!

On December 8th, 2023 I successfully defended my PhD thesis titled "Characterization of unsteady separation on a turbulent boundary layer". I had a beautiful discussion with the examination committee and gained a lot of useful insights. I now cannot wait to jump into the next step of my academic career! Stay tuned ...  

These 4 years at Queen's University have been the best of my life. I met incredible people, bright minds, and excited students ready to start their own journey. I had the opportunity to travel to conferences, publish papers, give seminars, and teach core courses in mechanical engineering. It's a path that I strongly suggest to anyone with a deep curiosity. 

A huge thank you goes to my supervisor, [Prof. Piomelli](https://smithengineering.queensu.ca/directory/faculty/ugo-piomelli), to my colleagues at the [TSM Lab](https://smithengineering.queensu.ca/mme/faculty/piomelli/tsm-lab.html), and to the wonderful admin & academic staff of the [Mechanical and Materials Engineering Department](https://smithengineering.queensu.ca/mme/index.html) in the Stephen J. R. Smith Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science at Queen's University. You have been part of my journey and I will cherish every single memory.
