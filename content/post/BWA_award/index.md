## Overview
Presented on an annual basis, this award recognizes a teaching assistant of Mechanical Engineering for their contribution to the undergraduate class as voted by all years (2nd , 3rd and 4th ).

I want to extend my profound gratitude to my wife Veronica, who has the courage to stand by my side every single day, to everyone in the Department, including my supervisor [Prof. Piomelli](https://me.queensu.ca/People/Piomelli/index.html) and my fellow colleagues at the [TSM-Lab](https://me.queensu.ca/People/Piomelli/TSMLab.html), and to every instructor I have had the pleasure to work with.
