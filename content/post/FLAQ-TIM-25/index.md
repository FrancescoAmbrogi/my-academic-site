## Overview
The FLuid Alliance at Queen's university had a strong presence at the 2025 1000 island meeting for fluid dynamics. Three faculty members (including myself) along with a postdoctoral fellow and several undergraduate and graduate students participated at this fantastic conference.

Organized by my fellow colleague and fluids enthusiast, [John Kurelek](https://smithengineering.queensu.ca/directory/faculty/john-w-kurelek.html) the conference was a stunning success with a large number of attendees form across Canada and US and VERY HIGH quality presentations.

In the beatiful cover photo shot during the very last day when the sun finally decided it was time to give us a break we have: [Barbara Da Silva](https://smithengineering.queensu.ca/directory/faculty/barbara-l-da-silva.html), Katie Cooper-Gray, Keaghan Paterson, Aidan Westdal, myself, Supun Pieris, Justin Sandasagra, and John Kurelek.

It was just a fantastic experience!
Till next year TIM!
