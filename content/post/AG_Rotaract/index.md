## Overview
My journey in Rotaract in Canada begun on April 2021 when I joined the Rotaract Club of Kingston as a regular member. Soon after, it became very clear to me that I wanted to be more involved in the community and help in anyway I could.

On July 2022 I became the President of the Kingston Rotaract Club. Covid-19 had a very bad impact on our Club, which at that time had only 4 active members. I decided the focus of my year to be "**giving help to all new comers to Kingston**" with a particular enphasis on families coming from countries with geopolitical issues, or refugees from Syria and Ukraine. I started a fruitful collaboration with the Newcomer center at KEYS in Kingston, and we organized several fundraisers and events to support newcomers and refugess in our community (for more details check our [website](https://www.rotaractclubofkingston.com/)). All these activities generated interest in many youg professionals and graduate students and our Club went from 4 active members to more than 10. On a District level, I became part of the committee in charge of organizing the Rotary District Conference for 2024 during DG Pardeep year (check the [DisCon24](https://www.rotary7040.com/sitepage/discon-2024) website).

As of July 2023 I was appointed Assistant Governor Rotaract and I will have the priviledge to work with the district leadership to ensure Rotaract and Rotaractors thrive in our District. I look very much forward to this new amazing opportunity, and I hope many other young professionals will get interested in the beautiful word of Rotaract.
