My name is Francesco Ambrogi. I recently defended my PhD thesis at Queen's University, Kingston Ontario. During my PhD I worked in the [Turbulence Simulation and Modeling (TSM) laboratory](https://smithengineering.queensu.ca/mme/faculty/piomelli/tsm-lab) under the supervision of [Prof. Ugo Piomelli](https://smithengineering.queensu.ca/directory/faculty/ugo-piomelli). My research focuses on computational and theoretical studies of turbulent boundary layers (TBLs) with pressure gradients. Specifically, I am interested in simulating the effect of strong unsteady adverse and favorable pressure gradients on the physics of wall bounded flows. As of today, I am an adjunct professor at [Queen's](https://www.queensu.ca/) and [RMC](https://www.rmc-cmr.ca/en/registrars-office/mechanical-aeronautical-engineering-undergraduate-programmes) where I teach Fluid Mechanics and Advanced Fluid Mechanics to engineering students.

On a more personal note, I am fascinated by astronomy and I love reading. Since April 2021 I am a member of the [Kingston Rotaract Club](https://www.rotaractclubofkingston.com/meet-the-team). Since then, I have served as club president and treasurer. I enjoy outdoor activities and one of my strongest passions is teaching.
