Dr. Francesco Ambrogi obtained his PhD from Queenâ€™s University in December 2023 under the supervision of Prof. Ugo Piomelli. During his PhD, he worked as a graduate research assistant in the [Turbulence Simulation and Modelling (TSM) laboratory](https://smithengineering.queensu.ca/mme/faculty/piomelli/tsm-lab), and as a teaching fellow in the Mechanical and Materials Engineering department where he taught Fluid Mechanics to second year engineering students. During his PhD his research focused on computational and theoretical studies of turbulent boundary layers (TBLs) with pressure gradients. Specifically, he was interested in simulating the effect of strong unsteady adverse and favorable pressure gradients on the physics of wall bounded flows. As of June 2024, Dr. Ambrogi is a postdoctoral research fellow at University of Waterloo where he works in the [Multi-Physics Interaction (MPI) Lab](https://www.mpilab.ca/home) led by Dr. Hickey, and his research focuses on invesitgating surface clustering in non-isothermal particle-laden turbulent flows.

On a more personal note, Francesco is fascinated by astronomy and loves reading. Since April 2021 Francesco is a member of the [Kingston Rotaract Club](https://www.rotaractclubofkingston.com/meet-the-team). Since then, he served as club president and treasurer. Francesco enjoys outdoor activities and one of his strongest passions is teaching.
