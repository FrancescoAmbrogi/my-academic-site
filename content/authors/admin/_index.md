Dr. Francesco Ambrogi earned his PhD from Queen’s University in December 2023, supervised by Prof. Ugo Piomelli. During his doctoral studies, he served as a Graduate Research Assistant in the [Turbulence Simulation and Modelling (TSM) Laboratory](https://smithengineering.queensu.ca/mme/faculty/piomelli/tsm-lab) and as a Teaching Fellow in the Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, instructing second-year engineering students in Fluid Mechanics. His research concentrated on computational and theoretical analyses of turbulent boundary layers (TBLs) under pressure gradients, with a particular focus on simulating the effects of strong, unsteady adverse and favorable pressure gradients on wall-bounded flows. Following a brief postdoctoral tenure at the University of Waterloo, Dr. Ambrogi joined Queen’s University’s Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering as an Adjunct Assistant Professor, where he currently teaches thermo-fluids courses.

Beyond academia, Dr. Ambrogi has a keen interest in astronomy and literature. A member of the [Rotary Club of Kingston](https://www.kingstonrotary.ca/) since June 2024, following three years with the Kingston Rotaract Club, he contributes to the Youth and Social Media Committees. Passionate about engineering education, he also enjoys outdoor pursuits.
