I earned my PhD from Queen’s University in 2024, under the supervision of professor [Ugo Piomelli](https://smithengineering.queensu.ca/directory/faculty/ugo-piomelli). During the past two years, I taught a variety of core Queen's Mechanical and Mechatronics engineering thermo-fluids courses as a teaching fellow or term adjunct. I am very passionate about engineering education and I have received multiple teaching awards for my efforts, including the [Silver Wrench Award](https://www.queensu.ca/ctl/awards/internal-awards/faculty-engineering-and-applied-science/mechanical-engineering-club#Silver-Wrench) for the past 3 years and a [EngSoc Golden Apple Award](https://www.queensu.ca/ctl/awards/internal-awards/faculty-engineering-and-applied-science/queens-engineering-society#Golden-Apple-Award) in 2024-25. I obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from University of Modena and a Master’s degree in Energy and Nuclear Engineering from University of Bologna, Italy. My research focuses on computational and theoretical studies of turbulent boundary layers (TBLs) under pressure gradients, with a particular focus on simulating the effects of strong, unsteady adverse and favorable pressure gradients on wall-bounded flows. My research has potential applications in unsteady aerodynamics (turbine blades, rotor blades, etc.) and biomimicry (swimming/flying animals) for flow control. As of May 2025, I joined the [Mechanical and Materials Engineering](https://smithengineering.queensu.ca/mme/index.html) department at Queen's University as Assistant Professor.

Beyond academia, I have a keen interest in astronomy and literature. I am an active  member of the [Rotary Club of Kingston](https://www.kingstonrotary.ca/) where I contribute to the Youth and Social Media Committees. As of April 2025 I am also a member of the Rotary Club of Kingston board of Directors. Last, BUT MOST IMPORTANT, I am a loving father and a very lucky husband.
