## Overview

During the Winter term 2024 I took on this amazing opportunity at the University of Waterloo: develop an open-source, hands-on, completely asynchronous course with the objective to bridge the gap between small sclae CFD simulations and large-scale computations on high-performance computing (HPC) systems.

Advanced Research Computing for Computational Fluid Dynamics, or [ARC4CFD](https://arc4cfd.github.io/), is a 16-hour online, asynchronous course to help learners with a basic understanding of fluid dynamics and CFD bridge the knowledge gap towards the effective utilization of CFD on modern ARC resources.

## Target audience

1. new graduate students in computational physics or engineering
2. experimentalist and theoreticians complementing their work with numerical simulations on HPC
3. undergraduate students on student design teams interested in leveraging CFD on HPC

The prerequisites for the course are listed [here](https://arc4cfd.github.io/prereqs/).

## Learning outcomes

At the end of this course, the learner should be able to:

1. Define the main concepts in parallel and high performance computing
2. Conduct an a priori estimate of the computational cost of a CFD simulation
3. Explain the impact of modelling assumptions on HPC cost
4. Optimize simulation and parameters of a CFD problem for HPC
5. Develop a research data management strategy for a CFD workflow
