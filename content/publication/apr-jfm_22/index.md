abstract: A spatially developing turbulent boundary layer subject to a space- and time-dependent pressure gradient is analysed via large-eddy simulation. The unsteadiness is prescribed by imposing an oscillating suctionâ€“blowing velocity profile at the top boundary of the computational domain. The alternating favourable and adverse pressure gradients cause the flow to separate and reattach to the wall periodically. A range of reduced frequencies $k$ was investigated, spanning from a very rapid flutter-like motion to a slow, quasi-steady flapping. The Reynolds number based on the boundary-layer displacement thickness $\delta_o^\star$ at the inflow plane is $Re^\star=1000$. Both time- and phase-averaged fields are analysed and results are compared with steady conditions. The reduced frequency $k$ has a significant effect on the transient flow-separation process. For high $k$ the separation bubble does not grow as thick as in the corresponding steady case, but the length of the bubble remains comparable; hysteresis is observed in the near-wall region. As $k$ is reduced, a threshold is met at which the separation bubble grows in the wall-normal direction. However, the length of the bubble is significantly reduced again when compared with the steady case. At this frequency, the region of slow-moving fluid generated by the flow reversal is advected downstream, causing a decorrelation between the forcing (the imposed free-stream velocity) and the velocity and pressure downstream of the separation bubble. Moreover, hysteresis effects are shifted away from the wall. At the lowest frequency a quasi-steady solution is approached; however, transient effects are still present in the backflow region.
